# main.py
Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) with Python

This code uses the hmac and hashlib libraries to generate a TOTP based on the current time interval and a shared secret. The generate_otp() function takes a secret as input and returns a 6-digit OTP. The verify_otp() function takes an OTP and a secret as input and returns True if the OTP is correct and False if it is not.

You will need to replace the secret with a secret that is shared between the server and the client (e.g. a user's phone number). You can then use the generate_otp() function to generate an OTP and send it to the user, and use the verify_otp() function to verify the OTP when it is entered by the user.

#send_totp.py
This code uses the smtplib library to send an email using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). It generates a TOTP using the generate_otp() function from the previous example, and includes the OTP in the body of the email.

You will need to replace the smtp.example.com with the address of your SMTP server, and replace the sender and receiver variables with the appropriate email addresses.
